    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Whiskey Chaser was created to help people hunt for rare whiskeys in Virginia.</p>
    <p>The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority (ABC) randomizes the store locations and times when certain highly-sought products are stocked. You can get notified by email when there is a limited availability product drop by subscribing to the Spirited Virginia e-Newsletter <a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/sv-enews">here</a>.</p>
    <p>When there is a drop, the email links you to a page like <a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/limited/allocated_stores_11_15_2023_04_35_pmis0YmpcG1q02xUozLfC4mhke.html">this one</a>. That page lists all the ABC stores in Virginia that have been authorized to sell any limited availability products in stock at that time. The stores are listed in alphabetical order by location, so it's hard to know if a store near you might be one with rare whiskeys at a glance.</p>
    <p>Whiskey Chaser takes the information from that page and organizes it by distance from you. So the store closest to you that might have limited availability proucts for sale will show up at the top.</p>
    <p>The emails don't go out to everyone at exactly the same time, and Whiskey Chaser is not affiliated with Virginia ABC and doesn't have any special privileges. So you might get the drop email a couple minutes before Whiskey Chaser does. If that happens, you can forward the drop email (or just the drop link) to <a href="mailto:hannah@mail.whiskeychaser.org">hannah@mail.whiskeychaser.org</a> to make Whiskey Chaser update faster.</p>
